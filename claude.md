# A online web fun game to play with my wife
## Battle Pigs

The game is like battle ships
But instead of placing ships, place cute pigs
There are 5 types

Baozhu Pig - 5 cells 
Zhubao Pig -4 cells
White Pig - 3 cells
Black Pig - 3 cells
Xiao Zhu Tou (meaning little piggy head) - 2 cells

The rule same as battle ship players hide and guess each others pigs and when all
released wins.

## Make the visual cute, each type of pig should be with cute pig pics

## Make the grid or platform warmful, like a farm or grass

## 2 players with room based, on player can choose name and create a room another pleyr can join

## web based, i am going to deploy in render.com (just heard of), prepare for that and give me detailed guidance to make it work
